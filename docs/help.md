## How to save images

Images are saved in the "data" folder when one clicks the "Save" button.  

They are saved as a .bmp file with the following naming scheme:  
image_a{insert value_of_a}_b{insert value_of_b}.bmp

## Image is not saved

Make sure you have the entire file structure, especially the "data" folder, as this is where the files are saved.
