# SinCos Art

This personal project aims to create generative art using simple parametric trigonometric equations.

## Equations

x(t) = 100 * (cos(t * a) + sin(t * b))  
y(t) = 100 * (sin(t * a) + cos(t * b))

## Instructions

There are five buttons and two text boxes.  

You can use the four main buttons to:
* Create a random art piece
* Go back to the last art piece
* Save the art piece in the 'data' folder
* To reset the screen to black.  

Additionally there are two entries / text boxes and a 'set' button. Use these to set your own values to a (const1) and b (const2)
